So that feature is going out tomorrow instead of today. Why?

So you experienced a live issue. Why?

So a stakeholder is panicking. Why?

So we have user stories. Why?

### It's all about a failure of communication

So some of those points may have some ridiculously obvious answers but that's the point of this post!

This seems like an obvious concept to mention but most of our failings are due to a fundamental failure to
communicate. After years of experience of working wih other people I can confidently state that pretty much 
all failures to deploy, set expectations, catch issues early, or deliver on those user requirements are 
completely rooted in a breakdown of effective communication.

### What can I do to solve such communication problems?

Communicate! Well, more specifically, communicate effectively at the most acceptable time to ensure everyone
involved for a certain work issue/item is confident in any actions being taken.
