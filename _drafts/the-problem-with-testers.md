OK that was one of those blog post titles to make you click through. Please accept my sincerest apologise which are never that sincere.

For the past few years I have proclaimed to my team mates that we should be hiring developers not testers. From further experiences and personal 
growth I do believe this bold and controversial statement to still be true but only for certain types of testers.

### So what types of testers am I talking about?
